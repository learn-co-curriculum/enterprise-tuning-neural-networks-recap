        "\n",
        "### Tuning Neural Networks\n",
        "\n",
        "* Validation and test sets are used when iteratively building deep neural networks\n",
        "* Like traditional machine learning models, we need to watch out for the bias variance trade-off when building deep learning models\n",
        "* Examples of alternatives for gradient descent are: RMSprop, Adam, Gradient Descent with Momentum, etc.\n",
        "* Hyperparameter tuning is of crucial importance when working with deep learning models, as setting the parameters right can lead to great improvements in model performance\n",
        "\n",
        "### Regularization\n",
        "\n",
        "* Several regularization techniques can help us limit overfitting: L1 Regularization, L2 Regularization, Dropout Regularization, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Normalization\n",
        "\n",
        "* Training of deep neural networks can be sped up by using normalized inputs\n",
        "* Normalized inputs can also help mitigate a common issue of vanishing or exploding gradients\n",
        "\n",
        "### TensorBoard\n",
        "\n",
        "* We can use TensorBoard to help us with the evaluation of models\n",
        "* We can use TensorBoard to experiment with the neural networks\n",
