# Tuning Neural Networks - Recap

## Key Takeaways

The key takeaways from this section include:

### Tuning Neural Networks

* Validation and test sets are used when iteratively building deep neural networks
* Like traditional machine learning models, we need to watch out for the bias variance trade-off when building deep learning models
* Examples of alternatives for gradient descent are: RMSprop, Adam, Gradient Descent with Momentum, etc.
* Hyperparameter tuning is of crucial importance when working with deep learning models, as setting the parameters right can lead to great improvements in model performance

### Regularization

* Several regularization techniques can help us limit overfitting: L1 Regularization, L2 Regularization, Dropout Regularization, etc.

### Normalization

* Training of deep neural networks can be sped up by using normalized inputs
* Normalized inputs can also help mitigate a common issue of vanishing or exploding gradients

### TensorBoard

* We can use TensorBoard to help us with the evaluation of models
* We can use TensorBoard to experiment with the neural network
